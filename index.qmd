Hi, my name is Max (_he/him/his_) and I am a computational ecologist at the _Coastal Ecology and Conservation Lab_ based at _University of Michigan_. I am interested in ecological modelling and especially in considering the spatial explicit characteristics of most ecological processes.

My research is mainly focused on how we can use spatial patterns to infer the underlying ecological processes. In this context, I use spatial point pattern analysis, individual-based modelling and landscape ecology. Lastly, I am always interested in _R_ programming.
