I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Ecosystem Modelling based at University of Goettingen. I am interested in ecological modelling and especially in considering the spatial explicit characteristics of most ecologicals processes.

My research is based within the Research Training Group 1644 'Scaling Problems in Statistics' and is looking at the influence of abiotic heterogeneity on spatial tree populations. I work within a temperate, old-growth beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest in the Hainich nationalpark, trying to asses the importance of biotic and abiotic processes.

Mostly, I deal with point pattern analyis and modelling, however, I also have expertise in individual-based modelling and landscape ecology. Lastly, I am always interested in R programming.
