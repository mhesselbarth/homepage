I am a computational ecologist at the Department of Ecosystem Modelling based at University of Goettingen. I am interested in ecological modelling and especially in considering the spatial explicit characteristics of most ecologicals processes.

My research is mainly focued on how we can use spatial patterns to infer the underlying ecological processes. Mostly, I deal with point pattern analyis and modelling, however, I also have expertise in individual-based modelling and landscape ecology. Lastly, I am always interested in R programming.
