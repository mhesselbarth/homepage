abstract = "Worldwide tree populations show a trend towards clustering. Possible processes leading to clustering can be either biotic (e.g. limited seed dispersal) or abiotic (e.g. habitat associa-tions). Although the role of biotic and abiotic processes is an extensive studied research question, no consensus can be found about the importance of the two process types. Studying small-scale habitat associations can give insights into the importance of abiotic process-es shaping the spatial pattern of the tree population. Most studies analysing tree habitat associations use mainly either one of two contrasting methods: the gamma-test or the torus-translation test. Both tests randomize the data to break possible dependencies between the tree pattern and the habitats as null model. The gamma-test randomizes the tree pattern data, whereas the torus-translation test randomizes the habitat data. However, we did not find a study explaining the decision on which method to use, considering possible advantages or drawbacks. To overcome this uncertainty, we conducted a simulation study to verify, analyse and compare the two methods. We compared the ability of either the gamma-test or the torus-translation test to detect habitat associations and how different parameters may influence possible study results. Therefore, we created simulation data with known, but varying strength of habitat associations and analysed if the two methods are able to detect the associations. Lastly, we propose to use pattern reconstruction as a modification of the gamma-test for tree populations with complex spatial patterns."
