abstract: Studying species-habitat associations is one approach to reveal the importance of abiotic processes in shaping the spatial distribution of species. Even though the R programming language offers many packages for spatial point pattern analysis, currently there is no comprehensive package specifically designed to analyze species-habitat associations. The shar package builds on widely used R packages for spatial analyses and provides an easy and straightforward way to uncover species-habitat associations for discrete environmental data.
