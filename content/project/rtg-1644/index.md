Choosing an adequate statistical model for an applied problem is the Ô¨Årst and often most difficult step in any empirical data analysis. In many practical applications, the statistical behaviour of spatial or temporal data depends particularly on the chosen scale, and the data are fitted to different, sometimes contradicting models across scales. The aim of this Research Training Group is to develop solutions to problems of scale that arise in current areas of both scientific and public interest. This comprises the identification of adequate methods and their modfication as well as the development of new statistical models and methodology.
