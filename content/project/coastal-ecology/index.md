The research is focused on how human-induced changes alter how ecosystems function and the services that they provide. Three primary questions drive much of the research: 

1) What is the role of biodiversity and community structure in mediating ecosystem function, particularly in the context of global anthropogenic change?

2) Can artificial reefs be effective tools for fisheries and coral reef restoration? 

3) What is the ecological relevance of trait variation (e.g., behavior) among individuals within populations?
