abstract: Landscape metrics are used to characterize landscape patterns and link them to ecological processes. Until now, there is no comprehensive collection of landscape metrics available in R. landscapemetrics is the first R package that includes most of the commonly employed landscape metrics found in the ecological literature. This allows reproducible and transparent workflows within the same software environment, including pre-processing of data, calculation of landscape metrics, and further analysis or plotting of the results.
