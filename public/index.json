Tropical seagrass ecosystems are among the most productive ecosystems worldwide, yielding tremendous services for society. Yet they are also among the most impaired from anthropogenic stressors prompting calls for ecosystem-based restoration approaches. Artificial reefs are commonly applied in coastal marine ecosystems to rebuild failing fisheries and have recently gained attention for their potential to promote carbon sequestration. Nutrient hotspots formed via excretion from aggregating fishes have been empirically shown to enhance local primary production around artificial reefs in seagrass systems. Yet, if and how increased local production affects primary production at ecosystem-scale remains unclear, and empirical tests are challenging. We used a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model that combined a data-rich single-nutrient primary production model for seagrass and bioenergetics models for fish to test how aggregating fish on artificial reefs affect seagrass primary production at patch- and ecosystem-scales. Specifically, we tested how the aggregation of fish alters (i) ecosystem seagrass primary production at varying fish densities and levels of ambient nutrient availability and (ii) the spatial distribution of seagrass primary production. Comparing model ecosystems with equivalent nutrient levels, we found that when fish aggregate around artificial reefs ecosystem-scale primary production is enhanced synergistically. This synergistic increase in production was caused by non-linear dynamics associated with nutrient uptake and biomass allocation that enhances aboveground primary production more than belowground production. Seagrass production increased near the artificial reef and decreased in areas away from the artificial reef despite marginal reductions in seagrass biomass at the ecosystem level. Our simulation's findings that artificial reefs can increase ecosystem production provide novel support for artificial reefs in seagrass ecosystems as an effective means to promote (i) fisheries restoration – increased primary production can increase energy input into the food web, and (ii) carbon sequestration – via higher rates of primary production. Although our model represents a simplified, closed seagrass system without complex trophic interactions, it nonetheless provides an important first step in quantifying ecosystem-level implications of artificial reefs as a tool for ecological restoration.","tags":[],"title":"Mechanistic support for increased primary production around artificial reefs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian H.K.

Because presumably all ecological processes are spatially explicit, especially spatial patterns can contain a lot of information about the processes shaping them. Nevertheless, the pattern-process link can be ambiguous. Reasons for this include different processes that lead to similar patterns, interact-ing processes that lead to random patterns or patterns that lead to processes and not the other way around. However, many of these issues can be dealt with using appropriate analysis methods. This includes meaningful ecological hypotheses, precise descriptions of patterns in the data as well as null models and model simulations to strengthen the pattern-process link. Biotic and abiotic processes were shown to interact in plant populations and to result in similar clustered spatial patterns. The clustering can be introduced by limited seed dispersal as an example of biotic processes, but also by higher densities of individuals at suitable growing conditions as an example of abiotic processes. Even though challenging, analysing spatial patterns in the data can be a powerful tool to disentangle the importance and interactions of these two processes. The aim of this thesis was to present approaches that use the power of spatial patterns to study the role of environmental heterogeneity. The methods included spatial point pattern analysis, individual-based simulation models as well as tools to quantify environmental heterogeneity to link spatial patterns to underlying processes. To this end, field data from a temperate old-growth forest was used. Overall, the thesis demonstrated how spatial patterns can be used to explore underlying ecological processes, even if contrasting processes lead to similar patterns as for biotic and abiotic processes. To successfully link pattern to process, i) meaningful ecological hypotheses are needed, ii) patterns in the data need to be described precisely using suitable methods and iii) appropriate null models as well as model simulations need to be applied to link pattern to process as unambiguously as possible.","tags":[],"title":"Analysing and modelling spatial patterns to infer the influence of environmental heterogeneity using point pattern analysis, individual-based simulation modelling and landscape metrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Borthwick","Alida de Flamingh","Maximilian H.K.

Species that rely on multiple, complementary habitat types (i.e., landscape complementation) to complete their life cycle may be especially at risk. However, such landscape complementation has received little attention in the context of landscape connectivity modeling. A previous study on flower longhorn beetles (*Cerambycidae Lepturinae*) integrated landscape complementation into a continuous habitat suitability 'surface', which was then used to quantify landscape connectivity between pairs of sampling sites using gradient-surface metrics. This connectivity model was validated with molecular genetic data collected for the banded longhorn beetle (Typocerus v. velutinus) in Indiana, United States. However, this approach has not been compared to alternative models in a landscape genetics context. Here, we used a discrete land use/land cover map to calculate landscape metrics related to landscape complementation based on a patch mosaic model (PMM) as an alternative to the previously published, continuous habitat suitability model (HSM). We evaluated the HSM surface with gradient surface metrics (GSM) and with two resistance-based models (RBM) based on least cost path (LCP) and commute distance (CD), in addition to an isolation-by-distance (IBD) model based on Euclidean distance. We compared the ability of these competing models of connectivity to explain pairwise genetic distances (RST) previously calculated from ten microsatellite genotypes of 454 beetles collected from 17 sites across Indiana, United States. Model selection with maximum likelihood population effects (MLPE) models found that GSM were most effective at explaining pairwise genetic distances as a proxy for gene flow across the landscape, followed by the landscape metrics calculated from the PMM, whereas the LCP model performed worse than both the CD and the isolation by distance model. We argue that the analysis of a continuous HSM with GSM might perform better because of their combined ability to effectively represent and quantify the continuous degree of landscape complementation (i.e., availability of complementary habitats in vicinity) found at and in-between sites, on which these beetles depend. Our findings may inform future studies that seek to model habitat connectivity in complex heterogeneous landscapes as natural habitats continue to become more fragmented in the Anthropocene.","tags":[],"title":"Alternative Quantifications of Landscape Complementation to Model Gene Flow in Banded Longhorn Beetles [Typocerus v. velutinus (Olivier)]","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Growing collection of small helper functions for point pattern analysis.

Wiegand and Moloney 2014). Spatial patterns in natural systems, e.g. the locations of individuals or other ecological entities (trees, bird nests, molehills, etc.), reflect the underlying ecological processes that cause their distribution in space. The two major groups of processes shaping the spatial distribution of individuals are individual-environment-interactions and individual-individual-interactions. Both have location-dependent effects on regeneration, growth, and mortality. The dichotomy of individual-environment- and individual-individual-interactions is reflected in the distinction between first- and second-order properties of a point pattern in spatial point pattern analysis. A point pattern is a collection of points (’events’) in an area, for example representing the locations of individual trees in a defined study area. Thus, in this terminology, first-order properties of a point pattern are those that are driven by environmental properties such as the availability of water or soil nutrients, while second-order properties are mainly driven by individual-individual-interactions.\nFor years, there was a strong focus on the exclusive study of second-order properties, i.e. on individual-individual-interactions as driven by e.g. tree demography. This was achieved by choosing study areas with homogeneous environmental conditions. In this case, all statistical deviations from average point (tree) density are presumed to be due to second-order properties (i.e., individual-individual-interactions). However, in ecological settings, it is often difficult or impossible to find homogeneous study regions. In addition, first and second-order effects may interact, i.e. plant demography may differ under heterogeneous conditions (Getzin et al. 2008). Therefore, the research focus is now shifting to the study of inhomogeneous point patterns, for example the study of the spatial distribution of tree individuals in heterogeneous environmental conditions. Most current studies operate with indirect measures of environmental heterogeneity, in case of forests mostly the density of adult trees (e.g., Getzin et al. 2008) and topography (e.g., Bagchi et al. 2009). Density of adult trees is a measure of heterogeneity in natural forests because survival of trees into adulthood correlates with habitat suitability. Topography can be an indirect descriptor of soil moisture distribution and large scale light and temperature conditions.\nIn the first cohort, the characteristic spatial scales of growth and competition were calculated in a near-natural mixed beech forest in the Hainich National Park, taking first- and second-order properties into account (cf. Saefken et al., 2014). The spatial tree distribution in 28.5 ha of this forest has been fully mapped in 1999 and 2007 and a third census was recently completed (about 15 000 trees \u0026gt;1.3 m; Huss 2006, Holzwarth et al. 2013). These data were kindly provided by our collaborator Christian Wirth. In addition, a previous RTG student mapped environmental homogeneity based on direct measurements of soil properties (e.g., water-storage capacity), distribution of vegetation smaller than 1.30 m height (including Ellenberg indicator values), light distribution, and distribution of woody debris. Furthermore, we have a digital elevation model at our perusal.\nIn the third cohort, we will intensify the study of the role of first-order properties for spatial point pattern analysis. A central goal will be to understand the scaling properties of different direct and indirect measures of heterogeneity, their interrelationships, and their effect on characteristic spatial scales of tree demography. Taking advantage of the data collected in the first cohort, and continuing our collaboration with Christian Wirth (expert in forest ecology) and Kirk Moloney (expert in spatial statistics), we will characterize heterogeneity in properties of soil, forest understory, light distribution and woody debris. Where meaningful, we will repeat field measurements and/or use simulated test environments. Central questions will be: What are the characteristic spatial scales of these measures of habitat heterogeneity and how do characteristic scales differ between measures? How can we combine different measures of heterogeneity (i.e., different data layers) to predict competition, growth, and mortality of forest trees most elegantly? Are density of adult trees and topography suitable descriptors of heterogeneity for the prediction of tree demography (as frequently assumed) or are explicit descriptors required? The space-time context of the last questions will be facilitated by the fact that tree data will be available for three tree censuses. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study in a temperate forest with an extensive focus on direct measures of heterogeneity in ecological point pattern analysis (for a …","date":1563408000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563408000,"objectID":"9131a559185d85c2827616c6fcc6bbd8","permalink":"https://www.maxhesselbarth.com/project/phd-project/","publishdate":"2019-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd-project/","section":"project","summary":"PhD project studying the role of small-scale heterogeneity on plant populations","tags":["research"],"title":"The Role of Heterogeneity in Spatial Plant Population Dynamics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Maximilian H.K.

Landscape metrics are a widely used tool for the analysis of patch‐based, discrete land‐cover classes. Existing software to calculate landscape metrics has several constraints, such as being limited to a single platform, not being open‐source, or involving a complicated integration into large workflows. We present landscapemetrics, an open‐source R package that overcomes many constraints of existing landscape metric software. The package includes an extensive collection of commonly used landscape metrics in a tidy workflow. To facilitate the integration into large workflows, landscapemetrics is based on a well‐established spatial framework in R. This allows pre‐processing of land‐cover maps or further statistical analysis without importing and exporting the data from and to different software environments. Additionally, the package provides many utility functions to visualize, extract, and sample landscape metrics. Lastly, we provide building‐blocks to motivate the development and integration of new metrics in the future. We demonstrate the usage and advantages of landscapemetrics by analysing the influence of different sampling schemes on the estimation of landscape metrics. In so doing, we demonstrate the many advantages of the package, especially its easy integration into large workflows. These new developments should help with the integration of landscape analysis in ecological research, given that ecologists are increasingly using R for the statistical analysis, modelling, and visualization of spatial data.","tags":[],"title":"landscapemetrics: an open‐source R tool to calculate landscape metrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian H.K.

Interactions between these two life forms are relatively well studied, whereas intra-life form interactions among woody plants only attracted recently increased attention. However, the influence of woody plant density is rarely considered. We analysed intra-life form interactions in a semi-arid and a mesic savanna to test for differences between open and dense woody vegetation in relation to large-scale environmental conditions. We applied spatial point pattern analysis to gain a better understanding of processes, such as competition, facilitation and disturbances, affecting the spatial distribution of trees and shrubs. Our results suggest that competition was most pronounced in dense vegetation, whereas facilitation effects were more common in open vegetation. Further, we conclude that factors shaping the spatial patterns differ with scale. At small inter-plant distances, results indicate limited seed dispersal as the most influential factor explaining the spatial distribution of trees and shrubs. However, with increasing inter-plant distances, environmental heterogeneity in the semi-arid savanna and disturbances in the mesic savanna become more important. We conclude that studying intra-life form interactions in savannas should explicitly consider actual woody plant density, especially if different savanna types are compared.","tags":[],"title":"Density-dependent spatial patterning of woody plants differs between a semi-arid and a mesic savanna in South Africa","type":"publication"}]
