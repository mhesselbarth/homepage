Tropical seagrass ecosystems are among the most productive ecosystems worldwide, yielding tremendous services for society. Yet they are also among the most impaired from anthropogenic stressors prompting calls for ecosystem-based restoration approaches. Artificial reefs are commonly applied in coastal marine ecosystems to rebuild failing fisheries and have recently gained attention for their potential to promote carbon sequestration. Nutrient hotspots formed via excretion from aggregating fishes have been empirically shown to enhance local primary production around artificial reefs in seagrass systems. Yet, if and how increased local production affects primary production at ecosystem-scale remains unclear, and empirical tests are challenging. We used a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model that combined a data-rich single-nutrient primary production model for seagrass and bioenergetics models for fish to test how aggregating fish on artificial reefs affect seagrass primary production at patch- and ecosystem-scales. Specifically, we tested how the aggregation of fish alters (i) ecosystem seagrass primary production at varying fish densities and levels of ambient nutrient availability and (ii) the spatial distribution of seagrass primary production. Comparing model ecosystems with equivalent nutrient levels, we found that when fish aggregate around artificial reefs ecosystem-scale primary production is enhanced synergistically. This synergistic increase in production was caused by non-linear dynamics associated with nutrient uptake and biomass allocation that enhances aboveground primary production more than belowground production. Seagrass production increased near the artificial reef and decreased in areas away from the artificial reef despite marginal reductions in seagrass biomass at the ecosystem level. Our simulation's findings that artificial reefs can increase ecosystem production provide novel support for artificial reefs in seagrass ecosystems as an effective means to promote (i) fisheries restoration – increased primary production can increase energy input into the food web, and (ii) carbon sequestration – via higher rates of primary production. Although our model represents a simplified, closed seagrass system without complex trophic interactions, it nonetheless provides an important first step in quantifying ecosystem-level implications of artificial reefs as a tool for ecological restoration.","tags":[],"title":"Mechanistic support for increased primary production around artificial reefs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian H.K.

Because presumably all ecological processes are spatially explicit, especially spatial patterns can contain a lot of information about the processes shaping them. Nevertheless, the pattern-process link can be ambiguous. Reasons for this include different processes that lead to similar patterns, interact-ing processes that lead to random patterns or patterns that lead to processes and not the other way around. However, many of these issues can be dealt with using appropriate analysis methods. This includes meaningful ecological hypotheses, precise descriptions of patterns in the data as well as null models and model simulations to strengthen the pattern-process link. Biotic and abiotic processes were shown to interact in plant populations and to result in similar clustered spatial patterns. The clustering can be introduced by limited seed dispersal as an example of biotic processes, but also by higher densities of individuals at suitable growing conditions as an example of abiotic processes. Even though challenging, analysing spatial patterns in the data can be a powerful tool to disentangle the importance and interactions of these two processes. The aim of this thesis was to present approaches that use the power of spatial patterns to study the role of environmental heterogeneity. The methods included spatial point pattern analysis, individual-based simulation models as well as tools to quantify environmental heterogeneity to link spatial patterns to underlying processes. To this end, field data from a temperate old-growth forest was used. Overall, the thesis demonstrated how spatial patterns can be used to explore underlying ecological processes, even if contrasting processes lead to similar patterns as for biotic and abiotic processes. To successfully link pattern to process, i) meaningful ecological hypotheses are needed, ii) patterns in the data need to be described precisely using suitable methods and iii) appropriate null models as well as model simulations need to be applied to link pattern to process as unambiguously as possible.","tags":[],"title":"Analysing and modelling spatial patterns to infer the influence of environmental heterogeneity using point pattern analysis, individual-based simulation modelling and landscape metrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Borthwick","Alida de Flamingh","Maximilian H.K.

Species that rely on multiple, complementary habitat types (i.e., landscape complementation) to complete their life cycle may be especially at risk. However, such landscape complementation has received little attention in the context of landscape connectivity modeling. A previous study on flower longhorn beetles (*Cerambycidae Lepturinae*) integrated landscape complementation into a continuous habitat suitability 'surface', which was then used to quantify landscape connectivity between pairs of sampling sites using gradient-surface metrics. This connectivity model was validated with molecular genetic data collected for the banded longhorn beetle (Typocerus v. velutinus) in Indiana, United States. However, this approach has not been compared to alternative models in a landscape genetics context. Here, we used a discrete land use/land cover map to calculate landscape metrics related to landscape complementation based on a patch mosaic model (PMM) as an alternative to the previously published, continuous habitat suitability model (HSM). We evaluated the HSM surface with gradient surface metrics (GSM) and with two resistance-based models (RBM) based on least cost path (LCP) and commute distance (CD), in addition to an isolation-by-distance (IBD) model based on Euclidean distance. We compared the ability of these competing models of connectivity to explain pairwise genetic distances (RST) previously calculated from ten microsatellite genotypes of 454 beetles collected from 17 sites across Indiana, United States. Model selection with maximum likelihood population effects (MLPE) models found that GSM were most effective at explaining pairwise genetic distances as a proxy for gene flow across the landscape, followed by the landscape metrics calculated from the PMM, whereas the LCP model performed worse than both the CD and the isolation by distance model. We argue that the analysis of a continuous HSM with GSM might perform better because of their combined ability to effectively represent and quantify the continuous degree of landscape complementation (i.e., availability of complementary habitats in vicinity) found at and in-between sites, on which these beetles depend. Our findings may inform future studies that seek to model habitat connectivity in complex heterogeneous landscapes as natural habitats continue to become more fragmented in the Anthropocene.","tags":[],"title":"Alternative quantifications of landscape complementation to model gene flow in Banded Longhorn Beetles [Typocerus v. velutinus (Olivier)]","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Growing collection of small helper functions for point pattern analysis.

We present landscapemetrics, an open‐source R package that overcomes many constraints of existing landscape metric software. The package includes an extensive collection of commonly used landscape metrics in a tidy workflow. To facilitate the integration into large workflows, landscapemetrics is based on a well‐established spatial framework in R. This allows pre‐processing of land‐cover maps or further statistical analysis without importing and exporting the data from and to different software environments. Additionally, the package provides many utility functions to visualize, extract, and sample landscape metrics. Lastly, we provide building‐blocks to motivate the development and integration of new metrics in the future. We demonstrate the usage and advantages of landscapemetrics by analysing the influence of different sampling schemes on the estimation of landscape metrics. In so doing, we demonstrate the many advantages of the package, especially its easy integration into large workflows. These new developments should help with the integration of landscape analysis in ecological research, given that ecologists are increasingly using R for the statistical analysis, modelling, and visualization of spatial data.","tags":[],"title":"landscapemetrics: an open‐source R tool to calculate landscape metrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian H.K.

Interactions between these two life forms are relatively well studied, whereas intra-life form interactions among woody plants only attracted recently increased attention. However, the influence of woody plant density is rarely considered. We analysed intra-life form interactions in a semi-arid and a mesic savanna to test for differences between open and dense woody vegetation in relation to large-scale environmental conditions. We applied spatial point pattern analysis to gain a better understanding of processes, such as competition, facilitation and disturbances, affecting the spatial distribution of trees and shrubs. Our results suggest that competition was most pronounced in dense vegetation, whereas facilitation effects were more common in open vegetation. Further, we conclude that factors shaping the spatial patterns differ with scale. At small inter-plant distances, results indicate limited seed dispersal as the most influential factor explaining the spatial distribution of trees and shrubs. However, with increasing inter-plant distances, environmental heterogeneity in the semi-arid savanna and disturbances in the mesic savanna become more important. We conclude that studying intra-life form interactions in savannas should explicitly consider actual woody plant density, especially if different savanna types are compared.","tags":[],"title":"Density-dependent spatial patterning of woody plants differs between a semi-arid and a mesic savanna in South Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Collection of your personal information This website does not require to identify yourself or enter any personal data.
