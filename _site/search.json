I am interested in ecological modelling and especially in considering the spatial explicit characteristics of most ecological processes.\nMy research is mainly focused on how we can use spatial patterns to infer the underlying ecological processes. In this context, I use spatial point pattern analysis, individual-based modelling and landscape ecology. Lastly, I am always interested in R programming."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nStudying species-habitat associations is one approach to reveal the importance of abiotic processes in shaping the spatial distribution of species. Even though the R programming language offers many packages for spatial point pattern analysis, currently there is no comprehensive package specifically designed to analyze species-habitat associations. The shar package builds on widely used R packages for spatial analyses and provides an easy and straightforward way to uncover species-habitat associations for discrete environmental data."
