I am interested in ecological modelling and especially considering the spatial explicit characteristics of most ecological processes.\nMy research is mainly focused on how we can use spatial patterns to infer the underlying ecological processes. In this context, I use spatial point pattern analysis, individual-based modelling and landscape ecology. Lastly, I am always interested in R programming.\n\n\n\n Interests\n Point pattern analysis\n Individual-based modelling\n Landscape ecology\n R programming\n\n\n Education\n Ph.D. in Ecology, 2020\n University of Goettingen (Goettingen, Germany) \n M.Sc. in Ecosystem Modelling, 2016\n University of Goettingen (Goettingen, Germany) \n B.Sc. in Forestry, 2014\n University of Applied Sciences and Arts, (Goettingen, Germany)"
