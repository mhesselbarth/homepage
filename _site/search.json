I am interested in ecological modelling and especially considering the spatial explicit characteristics of most ecological processes.\nMy research is mainly focused on how we can use spatial patterns to infer the underlying ecological processes. In this context, I mostly use spatial point pattern analysis, individual-based modelling and other modeling techniques. Thus, I am always interested in programming, especially in the R language.\nTo find more information about myself, please see my CV.\n\n Interests\n\n\n Forest Ecology\n Landscape Ecology\n Ecosystem Ecology\n\n\n Point pattern analysis\n Individual-based modelling\n R programming"
